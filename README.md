## âœ… SOLUTION 
The goal is to create a COVID-19 Surveillance App that can be used to monitor  COVID over time, detect changes in COVID occurrence (e.g., outbreaks), determine risk factors for COVID and populations at greatest risk so that appropriate action can be taken to either prevent or stop further spread of COVID. A useful Application of Data Science/Machine learning for Problem- Solving in Healthcare industry.

## âœ… OVERVIEW ON LINKEDIN
* [PROJECT ON LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gift-ojabu_covid19awareness-webappdevelopment-datascience-activity-6762296972004073473-cz47)


## âœ… MOTIVATION
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered Virus.Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.As the virus that causes COVID-19 began to spread from person to person in communities (community transmission),Medical scientists needed to track the disease and try to slow its spread. To do so, The need to build a system that track this disease as a Data Scientist came into thought.  

The Question popped up in my head - 

How Can I create a solution that checks the transition of Covid in the world?
* That was what brought about the motivation to build this project. Medical Scientists can use chart abstractions to learn countries more likely to become severely ill, what medical care patients have received, and if patients have recovered.


## âœ… WHAT DOES IT DO? 
It shows Live cases of people with Coronavirus, cases of recovery, and Death Cases for different Countries.




## âœ… FEATURES 
1. Real-time Cases of Countries Covid-19 cases(Ascending order)This part Update Every 10 Minutes.
2. Line Graph (Time Series Analysis)trend for Coronavirus worldwide cases.
3. Map Representation of Covid 19 Cases in different countries.




## âœ… WHAT I LEARNT 
<ul>
    <li> Using react and fetch calls to dynamically update UI.</li>
    <li>knowledge of API integration. </li>
    <li> Leaflet.js / Chart.js libraries were used to create the interactive map and  
    responsive line graph components </li>
    <li> CSS and Material-UI libraries were used to design animations and web layout. </li>
    <li> Deployment with Firebase. </li>
</ul>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
